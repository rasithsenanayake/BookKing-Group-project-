Indoor cricket is a modified version of traditional cricket, adapted for play in indoor venues such as sports halls or arenas. It retains the basic principles of cricket, including batting, bowling, and fielding, but is played on a smaller, enclosed pitch with modified rules to suit the indoor environment. The game is typically played between two teams, each consisting of eight players, with matches divided into innings. Unlike outdoor cricket, indoor cricket features a synthetic playing surface and walls surrounding the pitch, which are used for scoring runs off rebounds. The pitch itself is shorter than a traditional cricket pitch, and bowlers deliver the ball underarm to minimize the risk of damage to the indoor facilities. Fielders must also adapt their tactics, using the walls strategically to catch or stop the ball. Indoor cricket emphasizes fast-paced action, with matches often played in a limited time frame or with a reduced number of overs. It requires players to possess quick reflexes, agility, and adaptability to succeed in the dynamic indoor environment. Indoor cricket leagues and competitions are popular in many regions, providing opportunities for players of all ages and skill levels to participate in this exciting and accessible form of the game.
