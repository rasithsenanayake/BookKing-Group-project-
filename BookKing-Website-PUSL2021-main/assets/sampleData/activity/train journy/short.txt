This slow, 10-hour long journey might be inconvenient for the modern-day traveller, but it's so enchantingly scenic that it's become a bucket list adventure for many visitors. It's not just the views that has travellers in awe. The train journey itself has become an Instagram sensation in recent years, with travel bloggers risking their lives to take photos of themselves hanging off the door as the train rumbles past rickety bridges (some of them have been criticised for their dramatic poses)
