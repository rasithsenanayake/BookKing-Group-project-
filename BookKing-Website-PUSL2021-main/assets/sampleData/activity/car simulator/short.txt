A car simulator is a virtual software program that replicates the experience of driving various vehicles, using advanced graphics and physics engines to create realistic driving scenarios. Users interact with the simulator using specialized input devices like steering wheels and pedals, practicing driving skills in different environments such as city streets, race tracks, and highways. Car simulators serve purposes ranging from entertainment and gaming to professional training and research in automotive engineering, offering a safe and cost-effective way to experience driving without real-world risks.
