Horton Plains National Park, situated in the majestic central highlands of Sri Lanka, beckons adventurers and nature enthusiasts with its breathtaking vistas, diverse ecosystems, and rich biodiversity. Spanning over 3,160 hectares, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a sanctuary of natural wonder, encompassing rolling grasslands, misty montane forests, cascading waterfalls, and rugged cliffs.

One of the park's most iconic features is World's End, a sheer precipice that plunges 880 meters into the valley below, offering panoramic views of the surrounding landscape that stretch all the way to the distant coastline. The exhilarating hike to World's End traverses a scenic trail that winds through montane forests and open grasslands, culminating in a jaw-dropping vista that is especially mesmerizing at sunrise.
