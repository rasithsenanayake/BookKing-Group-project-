s its name implies, Galle Fort is surrounded by a large, ancient city wall. The city was built by Europeans (first the Portuguese, then the Dutch, and later the British). You can feel the European heritage vibe as you walk along the narrow, cobble-stoned streets lined with old colonial houses.
Inside the Galle Fort are churches, mosques, and temples â€“ an example of how different religions have co-existed peacefully side by side in Sri Lanka.
