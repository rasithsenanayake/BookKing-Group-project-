We connect you with the thousands of talented musicians out there that have opted out of the traditional music industry and joined the growing DIY (do it yourself) movement. These artists generate most of their income from live shows - traveling across the United States (and around the world) to bring their music to fans in house concerts, listening rooms, coffeehouses, public libraries, vineyards, cafes & restaurants and other small venues.
