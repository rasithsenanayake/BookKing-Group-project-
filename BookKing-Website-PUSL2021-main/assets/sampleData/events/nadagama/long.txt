We have already described two traditional dramas in Sri Lanka in previous articles. Today, we feature the last of this series, 'Nadagam'. Due to cultural relations and the tradition of getting queens for the kings of the Kandyan era from India, we received this wonderful traditional drama from India. In South India, this type of drama was popular under the names of 'Baghavati-mela' and 'Thurukuththu' or street dramas. These dramas are similar to Western operas and Peking musical dramas.The first nadagam drama to be staged in Sri Lanka was 'Harischandra', a drama which was very popular in South India at that time. Earlier nadagam dramas were mostly directed in Tamil; Peduru Silva, who was born in Modara, had translated 'Harischandra' into Sinhala in 1801. There had been many Sinhala nadagam dramas since then.
